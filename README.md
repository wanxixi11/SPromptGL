We propose **Semantic Prompt-guided Graph Learning (SPromptGL)**, a novel approach for multi-modal disease prediction that captures the discriminative regions of different modalities while enhancing their interaction and fusion. 

---

## Step 1: Data preprocessing
Running the code of data preprocessing in ./data/{dataset}/xxx.ipynb to preprocess the raw data to standard data as the input of SPromptGL.

For more details, please refer to [MMGL](https://github.com/SsGood/MMGL).

## Step 2: Training and test

Running 
```
sh ./{dataset}-simple-2-concat-weighted-cosine.sh
```

Notice: the sh file is used to reproduce the result reported in our paper, you could also run this script to train and test your own dataset:
```
python main.py
```
Besides, you can modify 'network.py' to establish a variant of SPromptGL and 'model.py' to try and explore a better training strategy for other tasks.
